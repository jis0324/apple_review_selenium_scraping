      "text": "What can I say tick-tock is a very good app it allows people to explore different hobbies like dance, lip-synching, comedy, cooking like everything you ever imagined and because of that there is a whole lot of people on the app. Basically if you\u2019re bored you let it go on TickTock scroll for you page can just get lost in how many videos of funny videos and interesting videos there are on your for you page it\u2019s amazing like there\u2019s laughs and cries different ways to look at the world and it really helps people like for instance  it really help me because I was going through a tough time and it just help me forget all the bad things happening you know that probably sounds corny but hey it works. You can meet new people you can collaborate with people you can do a whole lot of things you can start to become an influencer you can start companies the list just goes on and on. just to add on I really like the way how TickTock is consistent and persistent about their new updates because it's really good to keep track of updates that you have the latest things you can literally do a whole Lotta stuff even if I try to I probably wouldn't be able to list everything about how good TickTock is and how much is your fault from musically to now like it's crazy but it's a really good app I do recommend it\u2764\ufe0f"

      "text": "I\u2019ve been on Tik Tok since summer of 2019. As a tik tok addict but more of a consumer than creator here are my comments. I don\u2019t like the new update where it gives you a tutorial on how to use the app. I much preferred when an ad would come up when you first opened the app. We all know how to sue the app and if you don\u2019t, ask a friend. Second, I think you should be able to rewind/fast forward in videos. I know at one point you could do that with certain video and I\u2019m not sure if that is still a feature but I think you should be able to do that with all videos. Third, I think it should be easier for small creators to get on the for you page. All I ever see on my for you page is big creators. Fourth, I really don\u2019t like when the notification comes up \u201cyou are going too fast. Take a break\u201d because sometimes I\u2019m just spamming a certain account and that\u2019s annoying but also when that comes up sometimes I will set my phone down for a couple hours and when I come back, it still says that and I can\u2019t like anything even though I\u2019ve been off the app for several hours. All that being said, I love the app. It\u2019s a great way for me to unwind after a long day and also a good break."

      "text": "I love this app and probably spend to much time on it. I love the people on it but sometimes stuff is taken down for no reason or people report random stuff because they hate that person or take what they are saying the wrong way. Another thing I don\u2019t like is that you have to have a certain amount of followers to go live, I think we should be able to go live no matter how many followers we have. A ton of people on the app aren\u2019t that popular to go live. I also think we should have the dislike button back, people are just using it for fun and if people are hurt that their comments are being disliked because they wrote hate, they shouldn\u2019t have commented it in the first place. I also think if the sound is deleted or whatever happens, it shouldn\u2019t delete the sound of people\u2019s videos who have their video already made. I also think they should work on the sound when making a video with Bluetooth headphones because it destroys my eardrums when I go to make videos with them. I also think you should be more careful with who is getting on the app when they are below age and their parents don\u2019t know about it. I mean, if their parents are okay with it, they should be allowed to be on it. I also think you should be able to sort your favorite sounds because I often loose them when I add more."

      "text": "i love the app, it has many talented creators, and always seems to make me laugh every day. but there are some inconveniences that i dont understand. the community guidelines are very confusing. like the app takes down a tik tok for no reason. for example: one of the creators on tik tok\u2019s video got taken down for \u201cviolating community guidlines\u201d when all she was doing was lip syncing. and she wasnt wearing any revealing clothes. in fact she was wearing a t shirt and pants. but yet some tik toks of girls twerking and some tik toks of boys sayinf very sexual things don\u2019t get taken down? its almost like tik tok is picking favorites (and it also seems like they\u2019re choosing to keep the \u2018pretty/model-like\u2019 peoples tik toks up even though its all very inappropriate.)i mean no hate against those creators, but it seems a little sketchy to me and others on the app. and also there is a lot and i mean A LOT of hate going towards creators that didn\u2019t do anything wrong! there are death threats, messages telling people to kill themselves, and such terrible things being said to creators and i personally think those types of comments should be taken down. and some creators get taken down for no reason either. for example: i saw one of my favorite creators who in fact hasn\u2019t done anything inappropriate or rude to others got banned but people like perez hilton get to stay on the app? it\u2019s very sketchy and scary."

      "text": "i\u2019ve had this app since December 2018, when it first started getting popular. back in 2018 it was fun, no clout chasing, no hype, or any drama. but then in 2019 we started getting all of these big creators who started lots of drama (including charli damelio.) it\u2019s not their fault they got the hype, but the app used to be really fun but now all it is is just dancing and toxic people.. the trends in 2018 were funny, and didn\u2019t involve any toxicity towards anyone. the only time the app was kinda of toxic was when people dueted cringe tiktokers but they were mostly funny. i know tiktok can\u2019t change the algorithm since everyone has different for you pages, but that\u2019s another thing. people are claiming they\u2019re on \u201calt tiktok\u201d or \u201cdeep tiktok\u201d because they have cursed videos on their for you pages. and then \u201cstraight tiktok\u201d is all of the famous tiktokers who dance, like the hype house and unfunny type of stuff. and i know tiktok can\u2019t change that either, but it would be cool if musically was back because back then there was 0 toxic people and it was super fun And chill. and lately lots of people are getting canceled on tiktok too... anyways i think the app is fun and it\u2019s cool to see all the videos people make. it\u2019s kind of like vine, except not the same energy. if you are going to get this app just remember there are LOTS of toxic people and rude people."

      "text": "I enjoy this app a lot and all the thing that you have added is wonderful! The only problem is when you report someone, it doesn\u2019t do much. I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can\u2019t stand this app, it\u2019s amazing! And for another suggestion you should definitely add, make notifications for people messaging you and not allow spam if that is already added to the app, I suggest this app for you if you are looking forward to getting it! Enjoy \ud83d\ude0a"

      "title": "Great app but there could be some changes.",
      "text": "I feel as if, there could be many changes to this app. I feel as if comments should have some changes. As, the same typical comments go on, I think their should be some type of machine to stop it. I think copied comments, are so annoying. And they get more likes then the original. Therefore, every time you comment something that is not original, you should get a radar or notification that your comment will be deleted under circumstances. Another thing is , underrated videos! Now, I know Tiktok can\u2019t help if the person likes the video or not, but if people are seeming to really like the video, you should be able to pass it around the for you page. Good videos should be recognized, dark humor, light humor, all of that! They should be passed around the for you page, thats how people get big, and start their career. So basically Im asking for a change on the For You page. Now we all know, people like Sebastian Bails, Danielle Cohn, Zoe Laverne, Charli Damelio, get loads of hate! Therefore, Tiktok should have something that prevents hate. What though? A comment director. It will basically prevent all mean or hate related comments to be in the comment section. All you will see is love . But a little dark humor isnt bad. Just the way they put it. So, therefore their should be a preventer for that! I miss Musically. Bring it back."

      "text": "When I first started TikTok I gain followers pretty fast, I had about 80 followers and would gain more likes and followers with a good content that I would post. I had a pretty good platform and would never try to bash anyone or be mean unless there was a problem that included them harassing someone or me. Few hours before I got banned somebody had commented on a little girls post saying it was wrong the video was her duetting a older teenager pretending to fight him and shaking her young body parts at him. I bet time I had t three accounts, One where I would post aesthetics another one that was my personal account with videos of my dog and I my last one was me and my friend just making dance videos, on this particular day my friend and I saw the video of the little girl doing the inappropriate things I mentioned, and stumbled upon a comment that said it was wrong all my friend typed was that she agreed and he ended up saying that our account was wrong as well even though we just post dance videos I tried to report him and block him and saying that he was technically bullying us not to mention a little girl, when I was seven reported him and explaining my recent TickTock decided to ban my personal account the one that I had spent so much time and effort on! This really hurt my feelings and as of now I\u2019m still trying to get it back tik tok if you could please explain your reasoning for why you have been me permanently it would be great"

      "text": "i LOVE tik tok so much. i think i speak for most of the population when i say that basically all i do during quarantine is make and watch tik tok. however, there are a few suggestions that i have. my first would be that there should be a dislike button on videos. a lot of the time if there is a controversial video people have to like it to save it which gives that creator more clout. if you put a dislike button, it shows the creator how many people he/she truly upset. i understand why that could be a bad thing but maybe try it and take it away if it gets too bad? this next suggestion is one that i have thought of since i got the app. when i really like a video, want to recreate it, show it to my friends, watch later, etc. i put the video into my favorites. however, i now have so many videos in my favorites that i can\u2019t even find the video i need at the time. for this issue, i wish so deeply that the favorites section had different folders that you could name. this way, when you go to put the video in your favorites it asks which folder, you could name a folder, watch later, dances, show to people, etc. tik tok is a great app but please please please take my last idea into consideration."

      "text": "Let\u2019s be honest. If your gonna go on tiktok you\u2019re most likely going to get bullied or someone is going to say thing mean to you at some point. Even if you haven\u2019t done a single thing wrong, you will get hate. There is still people that are very kind and say positive kind stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair only popular accounts that have over millions of followers get on the foryou page. I have been on this platform since it was musically. I have never once gotten on the For you page and I\u2019m not sure why. Also if this app is for 12 and older, why would you banned someone who is 12 from live because you think they\u2019re underage. I am 12 and finally got 1k followers about 3 days ago. I have been trying to get 1k followers since 2017. When I finally got 1k, you banned me. The only reason I ever wanted 1k followers was so I could live. And because tiktok made an assumption that I was underage, I can\u2019t got live any longer. I also think it is very unfair that you have to have 1k followers to go live. Some people work so hard and make original content do they get on the for you page or get 1k followers? No. Accounts that have over 5 million followers get on the for you page that have unoriginal content that gets millions of likes. I hope you\u2019ll change your platform soon and make millions of people so much happier."

      "text": "I love musically lots but the new update just makes me hate the app. When you try to type in your bio you have a maximum of 20 letters. It is horrible. Sometimes with my bio I tried to change it and it won\u2019t let me I even counted my letters and numbers and it wasn\u2019t even 20 sooo..Another thing is when your scrolling through your feed it goes \u201cYour typing to fast slow down and take a break\u201d. What is that supposed to mean. Transitions are hard to do with the new one and I\u2019m confused with a lot of it. If you do update the app all of your privates go into Drafts. Which you can\u2019t use the audio you saved to your privates anymore. There is an option where you can save your videos private but they fill up your whole feed like on the old musically you could just click on your privates and they would all be together under one thing. One thing that is really making me mad tho is I can\u2019t see how many people have seen my musically when I click on it. It only shows the number of likes but who knows if those are the exact number of likes. The only way you can see how many views is on your main profile page. There is only one good thing about this new update the new filters but other than that that\u2019s it. So for those of you thinking about getting the new update don\u2019t get it. I love musically just want the old version back."

For example when i want to make a duet with my favorite Creator Jayden Croes, i\u2019ll make the duet then when i look to see how it turned out, it\u2019s like the video will be fine for a bit then it\u2019s like mine goes faster or something, and not in sync in Jayden\u2019s like how i first made it. I noticed it only happens when, i do duets with someone who has a lot of transitions in it. But still, can you fix it, because i\u2019m known for making in sync videos with my favorite creator Jayden Croes, and when i make them on sync it\u2019s like my video will go ahead of his therefore messing the video up, and i keep redoing it but it still happens. next i would love you to add a feature were because i like doing duets with Jayden, he has videos were he records with no hands, and then sets the timers to a certain point for it to end. why, is it that if you want to do a duet with that person you can\u2019t  hear were they stopped it at and the second they stopped the music at??? but if you don\u2019t duet the video you can here the sound, and the second but if you duet the video you don\u2019t??? i really hope you fix it because i really love making videos with him\u2764\ufe0f thank you."

The update that I\u2019m talking about is that update where the name got changed to tik tok and the background for peoples accounts where different colors and now it\u2019s just plain old white. I have a question developers, have you seen how much bad reports that you have got for the new update? Me and my friends hate the new update. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being a little mean I don\u2019t mean it. But developers can you please bring back musically!!! It will make my day!!!! How I want it back is remember when you guys had it like when you click on someones account, and it had a pinkish reddish and some yellow colors in it? If yes can you please bring it back?? And where when you clicked on the plus button to create an original sound it said slideshow or original sound? If yes then can you bring that back please? And another thing I wanna ask for back it when it was called musically may you please bring that back? 2 more things! May you please bring back where when you wanna make a musically that you want nobody to see can you please make drafts back to private??? Please! And the last thing was the musically symbol like the pinkish circle around sgigaly lines??? I hope you see this, love you bye\u2665\ufe0f"

      "text": "They got rid of messaging for anyone ages 15 and below. I personally think this is, while at first seeming ok, absolute crap. Not only do most of creators get views this way, a lot of the app is 15 and under. This can be a big issue for small creators or anyone with a fanbase targeted at younger teens. More importantly the app is already 13+ and I don't really see the importance of making messaging 16+ if people are just going to resort to messaging on other platforms about the same thing. If anything it's pushing people away from the app. This can also be an issue if you put in the wrong birthdate or just put in whatever one not really caring about it because they don't respond to the support tickets that people send out to address this issue and certainly don't fix it. Secondly they take down videos that creators post that have no real issue with them and won't say why they took it down, the only hint you get is they send you to the terms and conditions page about what you can post and most of the time the videos being taken down don't break any of the terms and conditions. A lot of the videos they do take down are fine or if they do have an issue, they leave videos that are practically exactly the same but on a larger creators page up. Overall the app has good creators and good people on it and the only real issue is the people in charge of running it."

      "text": "Hi, first I just wanted to say that I absolutely LOVE TikTok and use the app on a daily basis, but I have noticed a few things that bother me. The first thing is when you are uploading a video, you can\u2019t save videos,sounds,etc. This bugs me because there a several times I\u2019m on the For You Page and I want to save a video or sound, but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m uploading a video, and then I will accidentally lose the video or sound and not be able to get it back. The next thing is I only ever see people with 1.5k or more likes on my For You Page, and I would appreciate it very much if it were easier for smaller accounts to get views, because most of the time the smaller accounts work just as hard as the larger ones. The last thing is about the comments. I wish people couldn\u2019t limit the comment section to only ONE person. I understand if it is limited where only friends can comment or if nobody could comment, but I feel like limiting the comment section to only one person could make people feel not welcome and it is a big waste of a comment section. Thank you for making it this far in my review. Once again, I LOVE TikTok but these are just some small things I don\u2019t love."

I\u2019m not an angry mom or karen, but I think if something is innapropriate on there, it should be taken down IMMEDIATLY. I\u2019ve made A LOT of reports, and only ONE of them got accepted. I\u2019ve reported someone who told another to KILL THEIRSELVES and the victim that got told to almost DID! If something looks fishy, then I suggest to take down that account and ban them temporarily. Also, PEREZ HILTON SHOULD BE BANNED!! IDK WHY HES NOT! He litterally wants teens off this app, but the app was MADE FOR TEENS, adults and five year olds just snuck on there. I get like 10+, because that\u2019s the time they start learning, and have health class, but 9- SHOULD NOT, I repeat, SHOULD NOT BE ON TIKTOK WITHOUT A PRIVATE ACCOUNT. My sister is seven years old, and she\u2019s on private, no trouble, but there\u2019s some FIVE YEAR OLDS on here, that don\u2019t have restriction to any nudity or innapropriate stuff, then they think it\u2019s okay to make. The parents find out and blame you, that could get you POSSIBLY SUED! This isn\u2019t a safe app for kids 9-. On the bright side, if there\u2019s a vid that says, \u201cOpinions are available here, no fighting,\u201d I love it. Healthy and strong opinions with no arguments within it.

(People call this \u201cshadow banning\u201d) Instead of funny videos and videos that make me smile, I find myself feeling trapped on TikTok. I use TikTok to express myself and have a laugh once in a while, but now all I see is politics and inappropriate dancing. There are only a few good videos and everyone hates on them. I miss old TikTok, where if I was sad I could feel happy. If I was insecure, I would learn that I wasn't alone. And I know its great to spread awareness and share the news, but I\u2019m always getting in arguments over who\u2019s political views are correct. This app is mean\u2019t for children and teens. It\u2019s supposed teach you how to spread positivity. Most if the time I learn about dangers in the world faster than my parents. Most if the people on this app are too young to be into politics, including me. (I am 13) And yes, we should know whats going in the world, but not nearly half of the things shown on the FYP (For you page). I loved this app, but I\u2019m starting to drift away because of its new content."
